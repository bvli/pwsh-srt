Lieutenant Eaden.

Don't worry about it.

80
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,708
Hey man, l'm not worrying about it. l just think that it's 
important to know the signals for incoming rounds, all right?

81
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,169
Don't worry nobody's
getting in here tonight.

82
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,171

87
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,726
Sarge. Are there any women here?

00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:34,304
Come on Sarge, man you know. l'm too short for that shit.
The Doc ain't gonna give me a profile.

172
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,765
Why don't you see if there's a job
for me over at headquarters.

173
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,686
They don't take niggers
back at headquarters, brother.

174
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,063
All the white mother
fuckers are back there.

175
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,945
Remove the protective
wrapping from the tooth brush.

176
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,864
Put the wrapping next
to your left foot.

177
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,491
Open the tooth paste with
the cap on top of wrapping.

178
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:57,953
Now put general amount of
paste on the sterile bristles.

179
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:02,541
People you will brush your teeth
in rapid verital motion for one minute.

180
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,544
That's up and down for
you rebel mother fucker.

181
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,631
When l say Start, you turn
to your right, you brush. Ready?

182
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:12,759
Brush.

183
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,850
You may notice a granular taste.
That's pumice.

184
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,228
lt's puopse is to seal the teeth
and allow the flouride to penetrate.

185
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:28,400
Gentlemen, in Vietnam, you will be
confronted by many organisms.

186
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:33,238
ln food, water, air...
that are foreign to Amercan bodies.

187
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:41,079
Ringworm and Pataygo and Malaria,
ameobic dysentary and crotch rot.

188
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:47,878
lt has been found that proper dental hygene is important
component in maintaining of a healthy fighting man.

189
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,342
What are you doing?

190
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,345
Come on lighten up Bro.

191
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,482
l am not your brother.

192
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,278
Now did l tell you to spit?
/No, sir.

193
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,159
lf you wanna walk outta
this fucking place,

194
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,454
you will listen to people who know.

195
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:31,129
You be an individual, and l'll tagging your ugly toothless
face on it's way to a long box with metal handles.

196
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:34,758
Now brush your teeth in a
rapid vertical motion.

197
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,010
Troop!

198
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,185
Let's go!

199
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,981
Rise! Awake! Salute!

200
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:54,361
Another glorious morning.
You scroungy ass sons of bitches.

201
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,572
You found a home in the army,
Wortchester.

202
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:57,990
Hey thanks to hear you yong fellow.

203
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,326
Hey l'm low life of forty one
and wake up and out side of Vietnam,

204
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,161
Viet fucking green machine.

205
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:06,957
l'll probably be a fucking civilian with places to go,
people to see. Things to do.

206
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,885
l want you to keep on eye on these guys.
ln case we gotta go back to Ashau.

207
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,305
Don't mean nothing.

208
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,851
Man, don't these people
play no Tammy Wynette.

209
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,983
Did you sleep last night?

210
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,443
l kept seeing things.

211
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,862
What do you mean
you kept seeing things?

212
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:40,574
Did you sleep?

213
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,536
Did you hear something?

214
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,664
Oh this is bull shit.

215
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,917
You gotta sleep.

216
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,545
What are gonna do
stay hear for years?

217
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,257
All right, listen up.

218
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,512
You people are not dying
on me in combat.

219
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,515
You fucking, new guys will do
everything to prove me wrong.

220
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,351
You'll walk on trails, kickcans...sleep
on guard, smoke dope and diddely-bop...

221
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,145
through the bush like you were back
on the block.

222
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,858
On guard at night you'll write letters, play with your organ...
and think of your girl back home. Forget her.

223
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,070
Some hair head has her on her right now...
and is telling her to fuck for peace.

224
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,571
This is Han.

225
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,915
Those of you who are foolish will think
of him as...gook, slope, slant or dink.

226
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,124
He is your enemy.

227
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:36,004
He came over on the Chieu Hoi programme.
And he will go back there after he fattens on C-rations.

228
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,633
And he will be hunting your
young asss in the Ashau Valley.

229
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,593
Now forget about this Viet Cong shit.

230
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:46,390
What you'll encounter out there is...
hard core. NVA,north Vietnamese...

231
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,767
motivated, highly trained
and well equipped.

232
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,312
lf you meet Hanor his cousins,
you will give him respect.

233
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,524
And refer to those little bastards
as the Nathanial Victor.

234
00:21:56,108 --> 00:22:01,113
Meet'em twice and survive, you will
call him mister Nathanial Victor.

235
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:07,202
People, l am tired...of filling
body bags with your dumb fucking mistakes.

236
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,455
Do you think this funny?

237
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:15,377
Alphabet.

238
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,753
Languilli.

239
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:21,425
Han is closing in on your position.
lt's night, look at me.

240
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,428
l'm gonna save your life
and your gonna save mine.

241
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,973
lt's night, it's raining.

242
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,976
While you're thinking about peace, 
love and whether or not we should be in Vietnam.

243
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,688
Han is going to cut your fucking throat. And your sleeping.
/No, Sergeant.

244
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,442
You've been humping the boonies for months.
Your turn to sleep, your allowed to sleep.

245
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,737
What do you think Han is going to do?
ls he going to wake up Alphabet and smile?

246
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,238
And talk about women?

247
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:46,617
Mister Nathanial Victor gets his
rocks off watching you die.

248
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,870
Some of you think you have problems
because your're against the war.

249
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:54,041
You demonstrated in school... you wear peace symbols on your steel.
And you have attitudes.

250
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:00,631
l'm orphan, my brother's queer, the city of
Chicago got the clap from my sister.

251
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,341
Mum drinks, Dad coughs blood.

252
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,718
l have ring worm, emersion
foot...the incurable crud

253
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:08,096
and the draught ruined my chances
of being a brain surge on people.

254
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,806
You have no problem.

255
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,186
Except me.

256
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,356
And him.

257
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:24,840
Hey, pal.

258
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,221
You know where l can
find general Rufferman?

259
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:35,809
Not friend of mine.
He is major genral, two stars.

260
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,437
l am supposed to deliver
this to trailer to him.

261
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,480
And l can't find anyone to sign for it.

262
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,524
Hey l'll sign for it.

263
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,401
l'm responsible for this.

264
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,069
Well look at it.

265
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:48,739
Keepin the army forever to pay it off.

266
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,618
Everybody shoots at me.
Especially grunts.

267
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:58,123
l'm just rolling highway
sinder hunt and seek.

268
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,126
Listen, maybe you can
get a marine to sign for it.

269
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,507
Yeah. Yeah, thanks a lot.
Those guys are dancing.

270
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:25,901
This is one weird place.

271
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:33,075
Seventeen fucking wake up
and l'll never eat this shit again.

272
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:36,954
You hear what l'm saying sarge?
/We are in the army, man.

273
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,748
What are you gonna do when
you are back in the world?

274
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,795
l got places to go,
things to do, people to see.

275
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:46,505
Yeah but how are you gonna act?

276
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:53,387
Like a PFC, Private fucking civilian.

277
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,515
You are talkinig, you don't know
what you're saying, brother.

278
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,517
You ever heard of boony rap?

279
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,436
Fuck this, shit on that, no fucking way.

280
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,772
l love that mother fucking bastards.

281
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:06,567
You back off Motown

Look man, l got my act together. OK?

283
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:16,785
My shit's straight man.

284
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,164
You know a straighter and more intellegent brother
in first platoon then me?

285
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:25,711
Hey listen up, he's got college.

286
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,257
One time l went home
on special emergency leave,

287
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,718
My mama made me a
special meal man with

288
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:37,848
everything l love, l mean greens,
fresh vegetable, potatos, candies...

289
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,600
l happened to like baked ham.

290
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:45,189
So whole my family was there, and l said to myself, Motown
you got these people fooled.

291
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:48,317
l mean the day before that,
we were humping in Ashau valley,

292
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,819
and now l'm home with my family.

293
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,906
And l'm skatin man.
No problems. Number one.

294
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:58,243
l smile at my mama. Great meal, ma.

295
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:02,331
Would you please pass the fucking potatoes.

296
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,837
The ham is fucking A, ma.

297
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,967
You don't know how...how
fucking great it is to be home.

298
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:20,432
How you gonna act, huh?

299
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,101
You really want to know, Motown?

300
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,066
l'm gonna walk down Central Avenue.

301
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:32,152
My jump boots, my medals.

302
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:36,198
Shit, it's gonna be all right.

303
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,659
You'd better not wear your uniform.

304
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,453
Who's talking to you?

305
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:52,339
This man...has been fighting for the
fucking United States of white America.

306
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:59,096
And you going to try to advise him...
that he can't wear his jump boots.

307
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:03,767
You guys...don't know shit.

308
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,289
Commending General believes that
one of the most depressing problems

309
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,917
we face in Vietnam today
is Vineraal disease.

310
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:33,422
We have found the best way of contracting any one of
the nine known strands

311
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:39,970
of Syphilis, and or Gohnorrea is
to avoid contact with the indigenous.

312
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,389
Vietnamese female personnel.

313
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:52,774
However, remember, lie da
homo chai bokoo eeon.

314
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,694
Lie da homo chai bokoo eeon.

315
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,740
lt' the same anywhere Galvan.
You got to know the right words to score.

316
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,953
l'll go get us some shampoo.

317
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,347
Tafee.

318
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,848
What are you doing?

319
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,768
lt's called meditation.

320
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,316
How do you know
whether or not it's working?

321
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,529
lncoming!

322
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:55,379
Cold steel. Check point five...Two. Over.

323
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,006
Fire Major. Over.

324
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,054
Fire Major. Over.

325
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,518
They must have a
spotter in that tree line.

326
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,459
Fire! Standing by

327
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:41,049
Rounds out. Rounds out. Rounds out.

328
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,548
Cease fire. Cease fire!

329
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:34,311
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

330
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:40,859
Red 16. This is 16.
What's the situation. Over.

331
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,006
Who is it?

332
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:09,721
How the hell do l know.
He's got no goddamn head.

333
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,184
lt's one of the new guys.

334
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:19,773
You got to tell these men to put an extra set of l.D.
tags on their boots one each.

335
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:24,278
Then this kind of shit wouldn't happen.
How the hell am l supposed to identify these people.

336
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,408
Now you take it easy, Doc.

337
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,587
l'll take it any way l can.

338
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:52,389
l've got to know who you are.

339
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,603
How's this. How's this?

340
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,905
Where's Gates?
He's in there all night.

341
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,450

344
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:21,502
l don't care what y'all say.
You got that life all you want.

345
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:27,424
Now we'll see, Goddammit.
l'm tired of all your shit.

346
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:30,636
Seven cards are squared.
Single titties are wild.

347
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:34,723
You say it boss.

348
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:31,613
Yeah, you could fart in a balloon and
paint it red and Marine would love it.

349
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,365
lt's true.

350
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,291
Your too big for her.

351
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,963
What's Elstavitz doing? Vinstock.

352
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,924
l don't know Sarge.
/You should.

353
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,509
ls he...

354
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,637
You white boys are strange about that.

355
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,726
Don't get lost Beanie. Wooahh.

356
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:04,730
Watcha doin' in Vietnam. Boy.

357
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,651
Volunteered, bro.

358
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:13,697
You know, the brothers
are here, because we're black.

359
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,866
They don't think we're educated.

360
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,202
That's bullshit.

361
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:28,212
Say what FNG? FNG?

362
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,897
Hey Andy, lack off, lack off!

363
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:52,778
My name isn't Alphabet. lt's Languilly, Vinny.
My first name is Vincent.

364
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,448
What's my name, Doc?

365
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,785
You're name is Vincent.

366
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,456
All right, get him outta here.

367
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:12,422
You Gl's are all...

368
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,678
You people will not
die on me in combat.

369
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,429
Galvin was good.
He always did everything right.

370
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,057
What difference does it make. We've been up and down
this same terrain since l got here. For what?

371
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,267
All right look.

372
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,269
When you get home.
You can throw your boots away.

373
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,521
Grow a beard, become
a Goddam hippie protestor.

374
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,397
l don't want to hear this shit.

375
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,858
Look, l know too many
Goddamm names, Wortchester.

376
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,319
And l don't think one of them is
worth all of Vietnam Republic of...

377
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,697
Look just don't fall apart on your people, Francz.
/Oh why not?

378
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,075
So l can teach 'em how to fill sand bags and burn shit.
/Hey!

379
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:43,412
They're gonna need you in
the Ashau. We're going back in.

380
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,581
What the hell you think

Negative contact. Over.

385
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:51,368
Yo Mire! Francz. Smitty!
Move these people out.

386
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,539
You'll do fine LT. Just fine.

387
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,501
These guys know
what they're doing.

388
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:01,044
Oh yeah, most definitely.

389
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,978

00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:19,540

00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:02,142
Did you see him?
/No.

405
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,686
We got a blood trail.

406
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:06,313
Find the little bastard.

407
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,915
You're on point.
/Me?

408
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:28,252
You've got no friendlies out there.
Got a full load.

409
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:08,018
Nathanial Victor. FNG type.
Walking around the Ashau

410
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,729
with a half a canteen,
that makes a lot of noise.

411
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:13,232
Where's the body?

412
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:20,447
Maggie Kung fleet foot, face full of
black soot talking at the heat put

413
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:23,617
plants in the bed but don't stop them
anyway. Maggie says all right.

414
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,579
Here it is, October 19th.
We have been here six months.

415
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:30,582
Now that's half way. All right?
Now l'm going to mark myself in blue.

416
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:34,086
But l got different color pens for everybody.
You can be red if you want to be. O.K.

417
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:36,505
But what l gotta know is did Washburn
get here the same day as us?

418
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,006
Yes.
/O.K.

419
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,760
And that other guy and alphabet the day before.
/Thank you sir.

420
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,346
Hey guys, check this out.

421
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,225
Love this Camaro.

422
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,269
lt's you. lt's a ride, man.

423
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:02,155
We did good today, didn't we?

424
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,326
We got our cherries busted
today, didn't we Sarge?

425
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:11,915
One of my people got killed.

426
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,335
That's all that happened today.

427
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,928
You knew that man wasn't going to
slack off because he was short.

428
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:29,933
You knew that brother
was going do his job.

429
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,977
Then why didn't you put him on profile.

430
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,230
Because...he is one healthy individual.

431
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:39,484
l've got people in this fucking platoon
who are so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

432
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:42,279
But out here they have to
ruck up, move out and press on.

433
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,490
lt don't mean nothing, man.

434
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:46,992
lt don't mean nothing...

435
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,121
Come on, man...

436
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:55,000
You owe it to yourself...yourself.

437
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,762
lt don't mean nothing. Not a thing man.

438
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:28,534
lt don't mean nothing. Not a thing.

439
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:32,663
Right. You don't mean
nothing brother, not a thing.

440
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:39,294
lt don't mean nothing man,
not a thing. Nothing.

441
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,940
We got a.. we got McDaniels
body on a trailor truck.

442
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:07,823
All he wanted to do was go
home in his jump boots.

443
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,537
Couldn't believe they called him a jerk.

444
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,456
And worse.

445
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:25,215
Ya know, people get hurt out here.

446
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:29,595
C'mon. Don't tell me he died for God,
country and one-hundred
and first airborne...

447
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:32,556
Hey man, l'd never
say that shit to anybody.

448
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:35,726
Dan didn't die for anything.

449
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:40,105
He didn't leave his goddamn
guts on a goddamn trail in
goddamn Ashaw Valley.

450
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:43,233
For a home town medal
or any of that bullshit.

451
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:50,073
Cranked his automatic weapon
and took it out. For you and for

452
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:53,535
the third squad.Man, don't you
give him anything less.

453
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,457
You get out of this valley, Worcester.

454
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,002
l'm gonna kick your ass.

455
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:09,426
Battalion wants us to go back to
where Frantz made contact today.

456
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:13,305
They say there are some stragglers
left on this area Hill 937.

457
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:16,350
Those KlA's were clean and well
equipped. They weren't stragglers.

458
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:20,979
Military lntelligence says there is no organized...
Military lntelligence could fuck up a wet dream , sir.

459
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:25,859
All right man, let's call it. All right? We're on the same side here, right?
Tomorrow morning we'll just get our people quietly off this hill.

00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:33,084

00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:39,174
O.K. Let's move it.
Second squad. Move on.

474
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:41,510
First squad. Move out.

475
00:51:42,677 --> 00:51:43,804
This isn't the plan we worked out man.

476
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,305
We're supposed to be
going up that other hill.

477
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:49,684
lt's the same old shit man.
Man and bird wants to play war.

482
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,904
Move. Move. Move.

483
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:47,200
Put you around
seventy five meters down.

484
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:58,503
That's what l wanted.

485
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:11,892

00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,287
Languilli, remember the basic?

489
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:17,499
They told us the way to cover an eye
in case the flareoes so that we lose our night vision?

490
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:18,333
They said that.

491
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,876
OK, so what they meant?

492
00:54:20,669 --> 00:54:23,505
Does it matter if which eye we cover?

493
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:27,592
Good eye for the night vision
or the one for the flare.

494
00:54:28,301 --> 00:54:32,848
Beletsky do you stay awake at night thing of
the things you should worry about?

495
00:54:48,613 --> 00:54:49,906
What are you doing?

496
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:51,491

00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,044
l'm going straight to the PX
and ordering that Firebird.

501
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:06,256
What happened to the Camaro?

502
00:55:10,635 --> 00:55:12,637
My dad won't drive
anything but a Buick.

503
00:55:22,314 --> 00:55:23,899
Push in on the bullshit net.

504
00:55:24,775 --> 00:55:25,942
What's the bullshit net?

505
00:55:25,984 --> 00:55:27,235
Hanoi Hanna.

506
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:30,655
Best sounds in the valley.
And boy does she have a rap.

507
00:55:31,323 --> 00:55:32,657
We love you too much...

508
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:36,077
drop your weapons and Uncle Ho
will give youa water buffalo...

509
00:55:36,161 --> 00:55:38,330
your own rice paddy to shit in.

510
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:46,129
Sometimes they get American assholes...
to tell us what assholes we are.

511
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:50,634
No lie, man. lt's a trip.

512
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:53,929
American soldiers...and marines

513
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:59,643
embrace the heroic people of Vietnam...
like many of your heroic countrymen...

514
00:56:00,685 --> 00:56:03,688
why fight the heroic
people's army...while your own

515
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,984
Government betrays you...and the heroic
American friends of Vietnam...

516
00:56:08,026 --> 00:56:10,612
lf you have to smoke it at nigh
put a poncho over your head.

517
00:56:10,695 --> 00:56:15,700
and l would like to send this special dedication...
to the Screaming Eagles in the Ashau Valley.

518
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:20,205
You may be killed any
time day or night...

519
00:56:20,288 --> 00:56:23,792
like your shadow, death is following you...

520
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,710
Everywhere.

521
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,388
Bad dream.

522
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,936
How much am l supposed to
remember all this shit.

523
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:45,939
Panchos over your head,
no half canteens.

524
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:50,235
Dog tags on your boots.
Carry the claimor detonator while your setting them up.

525
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,238
Orange pills once a week,
whites daily, daily.

526
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,909
Oh don't ever walk on trails.
Boot in the sock. Harrows on the water.

527
00:56:57,993 --> 00:57:01,413
Secure your frags.
And now, now this bullshit.

528
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:04,374
And the whole time, l'm worried
l might forget something.

529
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:34,613
All right, on your feet, wake up..

530
00:57:34,654 --> 00:57:35,947
it's time to earn your combat pay.

531
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:37,699
Come on.
/Come on. Let's go.

532
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:40,911
Hey Motown, fuck you!

533
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:42,788
l need some goddamn boots, Sarge.

534
00:57:42,871 --> 00:57:44,873
My whole fucking body hurts.

535
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:46,082
My dick hurts!

536
00:57:46,124 --> 00:57:47,626
Then drop ten and beat it.

537
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,253
l don't want to hear
anymore of this shit.

538
00:57:50,962 --> 00:57:52,589
Now you get your
head out of your asses.

539
00:57:53,465 --> 00:57:55,425
Black Jack wants us to take this hill.

540
00:57:55,467 --> 00:57:56,968
What's he going to do with it?

541
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,557
Pave it and turn it
into a goddamn parking lot.

542
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,309
Now move out.

543
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:21,660
Cold steel, cold steel
this is 1-6 alpha, over.

544
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,912
Tell 6 that the little bastards
have got some Claimors in the trees

545
00:58:23,995 --> 00:58:25,163
And they're blowing the shit out of us.

546
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:26,748
So get us some goddamn fire support.

547
00:58:26,832 --> 00:58:29,626
Cold steel, cold steel.
This is 1-6 alpha, over.

548
00:58:32,003 --> 00:58:33,421
Come in 2-0

549
00:58:33,505 --> 00:58:35,340
There wounded out could be
pressing fire from that bunk line.

550
00:58:35,382 --> 00:58:36,508
pressing fire from that bunk line.

551
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:37,092
No shit.

552
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,302
Worcester, pull these men out.

553
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:42,681
Move it out! Move it out!!

554
00:58:48,186 --> 00:58:51,273
15 may

555
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:56,778
My leg! Fuck!

556
00:59:56,129 --> 00:59:57,756
You're mine! Mother fucker!

557
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:17,818
You fuckin' stink!

558
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:19,444
Tuffy!

559
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:27,077
Watch out!

560
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,169
Clear this area Motown!
Cover it point blank!

561
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:37,796
Set up that gun!

562
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:41,424
Where's Doc?

563
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:46,596
Get him and the horn and tell him
we got his goddamn bunker!

564
01:00:47,514 --> 01:00:48,974
Run the horn.

565
01:00:49,015 --> 01:00:50,142
l can't hear you.

566
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:52,060
1-6 Johnny!

567
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,689
lt's 1-6 out there over!

568
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:01,653
C'mon, help me down there.

569
01:01:01,736 --> 01:01:03,613
There's nothing wrong with you.

570
01:01:03,697 --> 01:01:04,906
Get down there.

571
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:08,285
Talk to me! Talk to me!

572
01:01:11,788 --> 01:01:14,958
Say Alphabet! Alphabet! Say it!

573
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:19,796
Cmon Tuffy! Tuffy! Say Alphabet!

574
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:47,574
Sarge,

575
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:51,620
l asked everybody who they think.

576
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:56,291
Nobody did it. Was it you?

577
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:58,210
Maybe he died of natural causes.

578
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:03,298
Half his head was blown away.

579
01:02:04,132 --> 01:02:05,884
Sounds like a natural cause to me.

580
01:02:06,009 --> 01:02:07,677
When can you get him out of here?

581
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:13,183
ln a boot coot fucked up dude from
the second squad ahead of Tuffy.

582
01:02:13,975 --> 01:02:15,268
Hey, it don't mean nothing.

583
01:02:18,772 --> 01:02:19,981
Where's my weapon?

584
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,769
6 speed advisor.
We have taken the bunker

585
01:02:57,811 --> 01:02:59,396
And are preparing to move up the hill.

586
01:02:59,563 --> 01:03:00,856
All right. Worcester.

587
01:03:12,117 --> 01:03:14,619
Let's move people
and take this fuckin' hill.

588
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:17,456
Let's go!

589
01:04:22,062 --> 01:04:24,981
Get me some ammo!

590
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:29,694
Tuffy! l'm coming.

591
01:05:06,857 --> 01:05:10,026
No. No cease fire.

592
01:05:13,613 --> 01:05:16,616
Hold it up there firing
at our people. Hold it up!

593
01:05:29,045 --> 01:05:35,260
Stop it! Man! God dammit!
Jesus Christ!

594
01:06:47,332 --> 01:06:50,043
They said they are gonna
send some resupply today.

595
01:06:53,922 --> 01:07:02,347
Get back on your horn and tell them we, our people,
need food and water now not later.

596
01:07:05,016 --> 01:07:09,354
This is 16 alpha over.

597
01:07:16,528 --> 01:07:17,904
Take a look at that map.

598
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:23,201
Sergent.

599
01:07:29,332 --> 01:07:31,209
We are in Ashau valley.

600
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:35,464
and we ain't going no where
except back up to that goddamn hill.

601
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:43,805
l'll get you a map.

602
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:54,941
You put the tape in there
and you press that button.

603
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,361
lt's from my girl Claire.

604
01:07:58,403 --> 01:07:59,654
Just don't use all my juice.

605
01:08:02,908 --> 01:08:06,411
Now that's immoral, unjust and illegal.

606
01:08:06,495 --> 01:08:07,704
Get this Beenie.
/What?

607
01:08:10,373 --> 01:08:12,876
Oh my God! They're huge.

608
01:08:13,543 --> 01:08:19,424
She likes to lie naked on the beach.
And have her boyfriend read the profit to her.

609
01:08:19,508 --> 01:08:22,511
Oh yeah, he's probably
a long haired, foureyed faggot.

610
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:26,139
l just don't know what to say. l-

611
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:29,017
l don't know what time
it is where you are.

612
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,938
l'd like to wrap his
long hair around my body...

613
01:08:32,938 --> 01:08:36,149
while he makes love
to me all night long.

614
01:08:36,233 --> 01:08:38,777
l had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

615
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:42,906
We read all your letters and looked at
the pictures you sent.

616
01:08:42,948 --> 01:08:47,369
She became his love prisoner.
She would do anything for him.

617
01:08:47,452 --> 01:08:51,248
Jesus Christ, l'm never going to get another haircut
as long as l fucking live.

618
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,458
lf you can...Joe.

619
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:56,753
Try to smile more in the pictures.

620
01:08:57,379 --> 01:08:58,672
lt would help your Mother.

621
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:01,174
Your dad didn't say much.

622
01:09:01,716 --> 01:09:03,552
We both know what he's like.

623
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:09,057
Katherine says...he gets up
early every morning and...

624
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:14,104
watches the news. And he eats his
dinner in front of the TV at night.

625
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:16,440
l think he's looking for you.

626
01:09:17,482 --> 01:09:23,113
l'm glad you have such good friends
like...like Bienstock and Langarelli.

627
01:09:23,155 --> 01:09:24,531
Languilli.

628
01:09:24,614 --> 01:09:26,658
Galvan and Frantz.

629
01:09:30,662 --> 01:09:32,706
l, l want you to know one thing...

630
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:38,295
l'll always be true to you.
l'll wait for you.

631
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,091
l know it must be very difficult
for you over there and...

632
01:09:43,175 --> 01:09:46,261
lf you can't be true...

633
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:50,265
if you can't wait...l'll understand.

634
01:09:51,057 --> 01:09:52,851
l know you love me.

635
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:57,522
l love this woman,
she's telling him to get laid.

636
01:10:01,193 --> 01:10:05,614
l wish you weren't there.
l wish none of you were there.

637
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:12,746
But l'm proud of you Joe.
l, l, l just don't think it's fair...

638
01:10:12,871 --> 01:10:17,793
that everybody is back here...acting...
acting like nothing is going on.

639
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:22,506
Their lives are the same.
lt's just not fair.

640
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:26,635
And l don't believe
what they say about you.

641
01:10:28,512 --> 01:10:29,596
Anyhow...

642
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:35,060
l don't care because l love all of you.

643
01:10:36,394 --> 01:10:42,901
Especially you, my darling.
Especially you my...

644
01:10:46,404 --> 01:10:47,614
Take it easy with that.

645
01:10:48,907 --> 01:10:49,991
l'll take it anyway l can.

646
01:10:50,075 --> 01:10:52,035
l told you not to use all the batteries.

647
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:56,706
lt's the goddamn nigger
music you listen to.

648
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:03,380
All right, come on. Break it up.

649
01:11:03,421 --> 01:11:05,382
Alphabet, put shovel down.

650
01:11:08,135 --> 01:11:09,427
Now what's happening here?

651
01:11:11,388 --> 01:11:12,556
War's happening.

652
01:11:21,982 --> 01:11:24,860
16 may

653
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:37,122
No! Fuck! Oh fuck! Doc!

lt's definatly the vet.

658
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:38,475
You can't score on the vet.

659
01:12:38,558 --> 01:12:43,980
Oh man, stop fingure fucking dream
with your chichen shit details?

01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,108
Let me tell you something, Linguilli.

deuce and a half while a girlsan reading a magazine

662
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:55,117
and sucked on pepsi.
You can score in the vet.

663
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,702
You owe it to yourself.

664
01:12:57,786 --> 01:13:00,664
Hey sarge, do you think they
gotta send us foot powder?

665
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:03,834
Stop worry about nothing for christ'sake.

666
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:07,546
Go back to world with bad feet.
What can they do to you, send you to Vietnam?

667
01:13:08,213 --> 01:13:10,841
l'm a salesman. This feet are my life.

668
01:13:11,925 --> 01:13:14,386
My godamn skin's peeled off.

669
01:13:15,011 --> 01:13:18,974
My socks tend to shrink.

670
01:13:20,559 --> 01:13:21,977
lt's from my girlfriend.

671
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:29,776
She said she's not gonna write any more.

672
01:13:32,404 --> 01:13:35,282
Friends at college told her it's immoral.

673
01:13:36,283 --> 01:13:37,868
To write to me.

674
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,875

How long have you been

684
01:15:45,787 --> 01:15:46,788

685
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:51,626
Hey brother, how many times have you

What are you doing here?

687
01:15:53,378 --> 01:15:53,837
lt's my job.

688
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,130
Bullshit.

689
01:15:55,714 --> 01:15:59,509
We've been up and down
this hill...nine fucking times.

690
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:02,345
Hey, word down at Division is
you guys can't take this hill.

691
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:06,725
What do you have to say about that?
ln fact, Senator Kennedy says

692
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:08,894
you guys don't have a chance at all.

693
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,982
You really like this shit, don't you?

694
01:16:14,941 --> 01:16:17,402
lt's your job. A story.

695
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:21,823
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture.
Watching for somebody to die, so you can take a picture.

696
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:22,532
lt's my job.

697
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:25,202
l've got more respect for those little bastards up there.
At least they take a side.

698
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:29,122
You just take pictures. You probably
don't even do your own fucking.

699
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:31,041
No one ask my AO.

700
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:31,958
What?

701
01:16:32,042 --> 01:16:33,543
You listen to me.

702
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:37,881
We're gonna take this
fucking hill, Newsman.

703
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:42,219
l see you on the top taking
pictures of any of my people

704
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,846
l will blow your fucking head off.

705
01:16:45,806 --> 01:16:48,558
Now you haven't earned
the right to be here.

706
01:16:49,976 --> 01:16:51,561
Do you understand that?

707
01:16:54,272 --> 01:16:55,941
Understand that.

708
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,917
l should have gone to Canada.

709
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,294
All they got is Eskimo's up there,
Beenie.

710
01:17:16,878 --> 01:17:18,964
The smart white people go to college.

711
01:17:19,089 --> 01:17:23,844
Not me. l'm going my two years, getting married.
And forgetting all about this shit.

712
01:17:23,969 --> 01:17:24,678
Never happened.

713
01:17:26,805 --> 01:17:28,598
You people must be aware...

714
01:17:28,682 --> 01:17:34,020
that the brothers...are here. Because
they cannot afford an education.

715
01:17:35,772 --> 01:17:36,982
What am l doing?

716
01:17:37,023 --> 01:17:42,028
Sitting in some...fucking country club
sipping on seven and sevens...
and eating a steak.

717
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:46,158
Take a look around l see
all kinds of white faces here.

718
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:51,705
Okay.The war Started for you...

719
01:17:52,664 --> 01:17:54,249
when you farted...

720
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:58,044
and said good morning Vietnam.

721
01:17:59,296 --> 01:18:01,715
See now l was born into this shit.

722
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:05,218
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon..
out of mouth so l could come here.

723
01:18:05,302 --> 01:18:08,805
And see how you low Class
eleven boos live. ls that it?

724
01:18:38,001 --> 01:18:40,170

725
01:18:48,178 --> 01:18:49,721
Hey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

726
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:53,141
Oh, the Sarge...the Sarge
volunteered for this shit.

727
01:18:54,768 --> 01:18:56,061
No, man.

728
01:18:56,061 --> 01:19:00,899
l was drafted, sworn in...and had
my haircut before l was sober.

729
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:04,361
The only reason l went
airborne is Collins.

730
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:05,779
Who the fuck is Collins?

731
01:19:08,865 --> 01:19:11,535
We volunteered for the reality of it.

732
01:19:16,289 --> 01:19:19,668
Don't you think l chased woman and good time...before
l got into the green machine.

733
01:19:25,423 --> 01:19:32,180
We got our orders from the big puddle.
Collins says...he's not going.

734
01:19:32,222 --> 01:19:34,516
And this one strac.
/You got to respect that.

735
01:19:36,309 --> 01:19:37,811
No way.

736
01:19:37,894 --> 01:19:41,314
lf you don't want to pull
on the little people. No sweat.

737
01:19:41,898 --> 01:19:48,697
Don't use your weapon. All l want from
anybody is...to get their ass in the
grass with the rest of us.

738
01:19:49,948 --> 01:19:53,618
You don't have to like it.
But you have to show up.

739
01:19:59,749 --> 01:20:01,251
No FNG's, no war.

740
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:08,800
There it is.

741
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:21,229
